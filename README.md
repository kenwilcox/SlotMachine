SlotMachine
===========

A Simple Slot Machine Type Game

Notes: I find it interesting that if you create a function in Swift you need to "name" additional parameters, but if you have a nested function you're not allowed to use the names - see function setupLabel in setupThirdContainer

Interesting: If you put a # in front of you parameter name then they DO have to be named when you call them.
