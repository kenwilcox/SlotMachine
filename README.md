SlotMachine
===========

A Simple Slot Machine Type Game

Notes: I find it interesting that if you create a function in Swift you need to "name" additional parameters, but if you have a nested function you're not allowed to use the names - see function setupLabel in setupThirdContainer

Interesting: If you put a # in front of you parameter name then they DO have to be named when you call them.

This just might be the ugliest UI in the world, but it was an exercise in setting up a UI in code.
